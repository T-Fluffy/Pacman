The gameplay is as every pacman game should be, true to the spirit of retro-arcade games :

You control pacman basicly with the arrows keys and try to eat every tile until you win or be eaten by the ghosts.
the big,round and pinky tile is the PowerUp to weaken the ghost and the fruits give you extra points.

Its a simple project using tilemaps, tile rules, coroutines and the same old OOP concept.
